## Overview  
  
The `zipfiles.py` script is designed to compress files and directories into a ZIP archive. It can handle both individual files and entire directories, recursively compressing all files within a directory structure.  
  
## Features  
  
- **Compress Individual Files**: The script can compress a single file into a ZIP archive.  
- **Compress Directories**: It can recursively compress all files within a directory and its subdirectories into a single ZIP archive.  
- **Automatic Path Handling**: The script automatically handles file paths and directory structures, ensuring that the ZIP archive maintains the original file hierarchy.  
  
## Usage  
  
To use the script, run it from the command line with the path to the file or directory you wish to compress:
